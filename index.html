<!--
	This is all the HTML we'll use. Aside from the standard config,
	and page title we have a single div, our rootNode. You can name
	this anything, as long as the refence to it remains intact.

	I'm also loading JQuery as it makes getting and parsing JSON simple.

	Next up I'm loading in the GSAP. If you do animation on the web, use GSAP.
	
	And finally we load in our Javascript. The Javascript we reference is of
	course the source that will be generated through Browserify, not the ES6
	syntax source we'll be writing.
