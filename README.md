# reactAthon_One

The GIT Repo for the first React Evening.

Linux and OSX users will be good to go, Windows users please download and install a terminal. This one has been suggested: http://cmder.net/

Once you've got a terminal and downloaded this repo, navigate (in your Terminal) to the root folder (reactAthon) and run npm install.

Once all the node packages have been installed (which the package.json file lists, and that is what tells the npm is required) run 'gulp' to process the source.

Then open the index.html in a browser and you should see a damn ugly but working weather service widget.
